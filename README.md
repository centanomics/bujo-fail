# Online Bujo

When it comes to Bullet Journaling (or Bujo), it's not uncommon to solely use one notebook for everything, including, but not limited to, running lists, habit trackers, daily reflections, etc. While this system can work fine there can be a problem with referencing things that aren't in the journal. Even within the journal referencing other items can become quite the hassle. What this concept plans to solve is to add that interconnectivity that is lacking in a phyisical notebook between the list items and links to websites that doesn't fit directly into a notebook. This would allow users to follow the standard system with bullet journaling with the added value of being able to quickly access the links or list items that your referencing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

#### Without Backend

1. **Node.js**

- Install from [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Check that your node version is higher than 12.5.0

```

If you **don't want** the backend to run, start the server with the dev-frontend script.

```
npm run dev-frontend
```

The project should be running now!
